## Execute Development Tasks

### User Account Creation

- Designing of the registration page UI with fields for email and password.

- Backend logic is implemented using Node.js and Express for handling user sign-up requests.

- Authentication is set up using Flask-Login for secure login sessions.

- A SQLAlchemy database is integrated to store user credentials securely.

- QA runs tests using Postman and Cypress to verify registration flow and fix identified bugs.

### Admin Product Management

- Creation of an admin dashboard with options to add, edit, and remove products.

- CRUD operations are developed using REST APIs and a database schema for product storage.

- Git branching is used for feature development, and pull requests are reviewed before merging.

- QA tests product management features using test scripts and reports issues found.

### Intuitive User Interface

- Definition of the user flow, ensuring seamless navigation across pages.

- React components are developed to ensure consistency in UI design.

- A/B testing is conducted to gather feedback and refine the interface for usability.

### User Feedback History

- Designing a feedback history page where users can view their past submissions.

- Backend logic retrieves and displays user-specific feedback from the database.

- QA verifies that all past feedback entries appear correctly and no data is lost.

### Admin Feedback Viewing

- Building a dashboard for viewing user feedback, allowing sorting and filtering.

### Feedback Submission Confirmation

- Implementing a success pop-up after feedback submission.

- QA verifies that messages are sent successfully and no duplicates occur.
